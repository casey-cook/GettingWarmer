Interactive game created with Vanilla Javascript.

**Can you find the secret location?**

After completing some self-study on events, I came to the realization that a lot of my favorite video games from the past probably relied on similar logic for mouse tracking. Essentially using the calculated difference between a cursor location and the coordinates of an item of interest on the window. 

Using that train of thought, I created this game to illustrate how that type of logic could be easily implemented to create interactivity for a player.
